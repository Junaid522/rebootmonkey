        Next to Remote Hands support, we offer  <a class="yellow" [routerLink]="['/services/smart-hands']">Smart Hands services</a>  too. Smart
        Hands support dives further into the software and solves more complex
        tasks. These could include installation, decommission, upgrades, ticket
        management, troubleshooting, auditing, logistics, RMA management, DC
        relocation, DWDM support, migration and 24/7 support availability.
        Remote Hands services are sometimes, but definitely not always, included
        in the data center’s services itself. Unfortunately, they charge high
        prices for this service. Smart Hands services will go a step further and
        dive into the racks and configurations of your equipment.

        <h4>Why Remote Hands are essential for any company?</h4>
        <p>
          Imagine this. In the middle of a Friday night, your server’s power
          system shuts down. You or someone from your IT department has to drive
          or even fly for six (and more!) hours to reach the data center and fix
          the server. This requires a hotel booking, food and drinks at your
          cost too. A simple task that could have easily been performed by a
          Remote Hands technician, and that wouldn’t have required you or your
          staff to be robbed from a good night’s sleep.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <div class="whycard">
            <img alt="tick" src="../../../../assets/sh1.webp" />
            <p>
              We have a passion for everything Hardware & IT. We love the
              flickering HDD lights, the fiber optics, and the wow factor we get
              when we've just replaced a 4TB disk with an 18TB disk. It's what
              makes our hearts beat faster.

          <div class="whycard">
            <img alt="tick" src="../../../../assets/sh2.webp" />
            <p>
              However, for many companies and business owners, setting up hardware
              systems that function well can be a real pain in the ass. That’s why
              we started Reboot Monkey. To help companies with their data center
              hardware needs and unburden them from A to Z.
            </p>

              We have close ties with many data centers and can buy, install and
              monitor any rack or server that you need. This way, you don’t have
              to worry about finding the right hardware products and who needs to
              install or monitor them. We can do that for you.
